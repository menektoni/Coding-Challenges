# Coding-Challenges
In this repository I will upload the challenges that I'm completing. Mainly they are little pieces of code with it instructions.
Hope you enjoy it and I recommend to try hard the problem before seeing the solution. Most of the challenges are from www.codewars.com

The structure of this repository is as follows: Here you would see a lot of folders. In each one you would have the instructions and my solution. This one works.

**Disclaimer:** What the solution contains it's obviously personal. It works, yes. But it isn't absolute. What means that a solution of yours may be different than mine but either way operational.
